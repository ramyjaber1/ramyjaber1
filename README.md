<div class="github-introduction">

I'm a **Web Developer** with a passion for bringing ideas to life in the browser. Growing up in the '90s and early 2000s, I fell in love with the internet, and that passion has driven me to design and develop websites and web applications that are **fast**, **responsive**, and **accessible** to everyone. I specialize in creating websites for clients with functionalities such as booking systems for apartments, hotels, restaurants, and more.

Additionally, I'm currently diving into the world of DevOps, expanding my skill set to streamline development processes and improve deployment efficiency.

## üåü Featured Projects

- Appointment Management System üìÖ: I am currently developing an Appointment Management System that streamlines scheduling for businesses and professionals. This project includes features such as automated reminders, real-time availability updates, and an intuitive user interface for managing client appointments efficiently. My goal is to reduce no-shows and optimize the overall scheduling process, making it easier for users to manage their time effectively.

- Project Management System üõ†Ô∏è: I am also working on a Project Management System designed to help teams collaborate, track progress, and meet deadlines. This system includes task tracking, milestone setting, time logging, and detailed reporting features to ensure projects are completed on time and within scope. My focus is on building a scalable solution that can adapt to various industries and team sizes, empowering users to stay organized and productive.

## üìÉ I love documentation

Not many developers like to write documentation, but I do. I believe that a well-documented codebase is as important as the code itself. It‚Äôs like a story, telling what the code can do and how it works. I always try to write clear, concise, and useful documentation. My go-to documentation tool is <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian.md</a>.

In addition to my love for documentation, *I'm currently working on a custom Obsidian theme* as part of my **Violet Void theme** series. This theme features rich, deep purple colors with transparency effects, providing a sleek and modern look. I'm already using it myself, and it looks dope! I plan to release this theme soon so others can enjoy it as well.

Whenever I write documentation, I try to keep the following steps in mind to ensure the reader gets the most out of it:

1. **What** is this documentation about?
2. **Why** is this documentation important?
3. **How** can the reader use this documentation?
4. **When** should the reader use this documentation?
5. **Who** is this documentation for?

### <p align="center">‚öôÔ∏è My development environment </p>

> I grew up with Windows, but macOS has become my go-to operating system for development. On macOS, I make extensive use of Homebrew for managing packages and tools, and I rely on WezTerm as my terminal emulator for a highly customizable and efficient environment. My shell of choice is Fish, which I‚Äôve configured with plugins and themes to enhance productivity. For code editing, Neovim is my primary tool, offering a highly efficient and flexible coding experience. I integrate Git for version control, and I also leverage Azure for cloud development, creating a robust and streamlined workflow on macOS.
